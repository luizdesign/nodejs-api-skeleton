# NodeJs API Skeleton
A simple skeleton to start projects using Node.js.

## Pre Requirements
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): v17.06.0
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/): v1.14.0

## Structure
The Api have the structure below:
```md
├── Api/
│   ├── Routes/
│   └── Controllers/
├── Dockerfile
└── docker-compose.yml
```

## Development

```sh
git clone git@github.com:luizdesign/nodejs-api-skeleton.git
```

### Running
To run the project, execute the command:
```sh
docker-compose up
```

After it you can access [http://localhost:3000/healthcheck/](http://localhost:3000/healthcheck/).

### Rebuild Docker image
To rebuild the docker image, run the command below. It's necessary to build a new image with your changes.
```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

Or you can remove and create a new image:
```sh
docker images #returns all local docker images
docker rm $dockerImageName #remove the image named $dockerImageName
docker-compose up #recreate the image
```

## Test
You can run some tests to ensure the code.

### Integration Tests
Integration test access the api and check te return. To execute them, run the commands below.
```sh
# up the Api
docker-compose up

# run the integration test
docker-compose -f test.docker-compose.yml up
```
